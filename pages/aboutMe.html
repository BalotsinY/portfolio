    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div>
        <p>Who am I? In a short list, which I use for just about all of my social media: WWII and tank fanatic, amateur gamer, lover of big guns, math genius, proud Belarusian.
            <br>
            The long version of that is I am a high school student at Rosemount Highschool, who has lived in the US for over 10 years at this point in time. I was born in the capital of Belarus, Minsk, in 2003. In 2009, my parents won the Greencard lottery on their first try, and not believing their own luck, decided to move to the US.

            Currently, I am a junior, the captain of the alpine ski team, am doing Linear Algebra and Differential Equations, studying German, am part of the German exchange program in our school, and overall am enrolled in 3 AP classes and 3 CIS classes. Yeah, I know it sounds like a lot, but I am the kind of person that thought AP Biology was a complete joke (I was gone from class for more than a month at the end of the school year and still got a 5 on the AP test). For now I am fine. They keep telling me that school will get hard, but I've been hearing that for years, and it still hasn't happened. I plan to keep it that way. :P

            I really enjoy history and especially the military aspect of it, and especially the military hardware aspect of that. I swear I could name almost every tank that was mass-produced from about 1936 to probably around 1970. I have about the same level of enthusiasm when it comes to computer hardware. I am the sort of person that will take off the side of his computer case every once in a while just to marvel at the components inside.
            <br>
            Though it may not seem like it, but I am quite a big fan of metal when it comes to music, though I am very picky in metal. Some of my favorite bands are Sabaton and Avantasia, but I also love Coldplay, Die Prinzen, and Armin van Buuren.
