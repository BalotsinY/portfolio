            Is water wet? I say yes. The definition of being wet is having water or some liquid on an object, and as
            water molecules touch other water molecules, that makes water wet.

            What is consciousness? What makes something conscious? If we are conscious, are our bodies conscious? And
            are we alive? Our cells are alive, are their organelles alive? At what point in the size spectrum does
            something stop being alive? If we are alive, our organs are alive, and our cells are, are the organelles in
            those cells alive? If so, can we consider the proteins that make up the organelles alive? Even if you say
            no, remember that alive things are made of things that are not alive...
